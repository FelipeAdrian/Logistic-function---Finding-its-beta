# Logistic-regression---Find-beta-s
In this project, we will generate a random list and apply the logistic function to estimate its beta parameters.

There are many ways to find parameters for fitting; in this project, we used the Quasi-Newton Method and the Newton Method itself, comparing them to Linear Regression.

It is important to note that the Newton Method changes according to the tables being analyzed due to the Hessian and Gradient vectors. Although it is relatively straightforward to find new ones, these vectors will change if you add or remove columns. Therefore, this serves as an example of how it is done, rather than a general method. Feel free to adapt it as needed.

Thank you
